CS101 Meeting Notes 10/17/19
- tried opening oifits data (turns out we don't need oifits, since it's for
generating the actual simultions)
	from oitools import *
	oidata = oifits.open('../../staticBlackhole/targetImgs/blackhole-01-05.fits')
	oidata.info()


Questions to ask:
Are we using images or videos?
	Yes, we should try both
Are we doing classification or regression? (would be the latter for mass and spin)
	We should stick with classes because the changfes might be too little (but within each class, the variation in the images is quite large). And with both parameters at once. 
	But maybe regression 
What features we’re looking for?	
	Spin and inclination since they're what we have right now
How many images/how much data do we have to train on?
	890 (89 * 100)

Other methods:
Look at neurons → maximum response in the input image (instead of reconstructing the images)

Use autoencoder -> outputting the same black hole images as the input, with a dimensional representation (bin it), artificially put in small encoding for mass 1
