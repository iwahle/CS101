CS101 Meeting Notes 10/18/19
- try classifying inclination as well
- figure out how to get mass
- checkpoint oct30
- next week:
	- get larger dataset
	- get mass
	- get temporal data
	- classifying on spin x inclination, coarser bins
	- put together gallery
	- try unbiased clustering
	- 2D harmonics as basis set to reconstruct on first
		- linear combination of orthogonal components with noise
		- F1 = sum fi Ki
		- F2 = sum gi Ki
		- orthogonality: if fi !=0, gi = 0, and vice versa
		- Iab = FT(aF1 + bF2)
